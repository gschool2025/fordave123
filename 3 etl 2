The following task is performed in SSIS.

1. Create a new project for Integration Services.

2. Connect the data set with OLEDB to the master database and localhost server.

3. Add a new package called database creation.

5. In the SQL Statement, create a query that creates a new database named warehouse:

if not exists (select name from sys.databases

where name = 'Warehouse')

Begin

  CREATE DATABASE [Warehouse]

END

After entering the query, change BypassPrepare to False and validate with Parse Query.

6. Execute Task and validate.

IF NOT EXISTS (select * from sys.objects where

object_id = object_id ( '[dbo]. [Data]') )

Begin

  create table [dbo]. [Data] (

    [id] [int] identity (1,1) not null,

    [col1] [varchar] (250) null,

    [col2] [varchar] (250) null,

    constraint [pk_id] primary key clustered

    (

        [id] ASC

    )

    )

Verify, call and check (correct error).

8. Use the Import Export Wizard to import the (1) XLSX dataset into the database.

9. Add a new Data Flow Task and name it integration of source files.

10. Add a connection to the MS SQL Server database containing the table created on the basis of the file from the previous point - the name of Data1SQL.

14. Create a table in the data warehouse named Data2 with three varchar (200) columns - k1, k2, k3.

15. Add a new package named Dataflow. In the type package, add Data Flow and design passing data from CSV file to Data2 table.

16. Create a new package named Dataflow2. In the package, add the Execute SQL Task, which will create a table named Year2010 with columns k1, k2 and k3 of varchar (200) type.

17. Add the Data Flow component to the package named Dataflow2. In this component, create source data (Source Assistant) for the CSV set, Conditional Split (condition YEAR_DIMENSION == "2010") and attach it to the target table (Destination Assistant). Run the package and check the result.
